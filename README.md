## Image To Cartoon Using OpenCV

This repository contains Python code for converting an image to a cartoon using OpenCV. The script utilizes Gaussian Pyramid for downscaling, bilateral filtering for edge preservation, and pyramid upsampling for reconstruction. Additionally, it applies image processing techniques such as grayscale conversion, median blur, adaptive thresholding, and bitwise operations to generate the cartoon effect. Explore the code to understand the implementation details and experiment with different parameters to achieve desired cartoonization effects.
